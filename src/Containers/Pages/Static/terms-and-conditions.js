                                <p>Belgium WebNet is committed to providing current and accurate information on our web sites, email, chat, and telephone communications. We do not, however, warrant that this information is always correct, accurate or complete. In rare circumstances, data, including prices, may be inaccurately displayed on our Site due to system and typographical errors which may occur. Inadvertent errors or inaccurate advertised prices are not binding on Belgium WebNet, and may be adjusted by Belgium WebNet at any time. Belgium WebNet reserves the right to correct any and all errors when they do occur. If an order is placed with a lower product’s listed price than the actual price, Belgium WebNet will, at its discretion, either advise the customer before shipping the product or cancel the order and notify the customer of such cancellation. Belgium WebNet apologizes for any inconvenience that this may cause.</p>
                                <p>Information that we communicate is not a binding contract, and should not be treated as such. The sole remedy of a customer acting on incorrect information is to request a cancellation of the order placed as a result of this incorrect information. If an order has been shipped, the customer agrees to either return the product for full credit or pay the difference between the actual and charged prices. Please review our Return Policies.</p>

                                <p>Belgium WebNet's product details and prices are also subject to change without notice. All of our prices are final and non-negotiable. Additionally, in order to conserve natural resources, and maintain the high quality of our pieces, Belgium WebNet does not allow multiple pieces to be purchased for comparison, which is the act of buying several items with the intent of keeping the item that you like best and returning the remaining items that were purchased. If you have any questions regarding our policy, please contact our Customer Service at <a href="mailTo:info@belgiumwebnet.com">info@belgiumwebnet.com</a></p>
                                <p>All representations including representations regarding gemstone origin, recycled content of precious metals, and estate information, are provided to the best of Belgium WebNet’s knowledge and without guarantee or warranty of any kind.</p>
                                <h2>Your account and order</h2>
                                <p>When you access or use the Belgium WebNet website or your personalized Belgium WebNet account, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for restricting access to your computer.

                                <p>When you order a loose diamond, Belgium WebNet will ship it to you with the accompanying diamond certificate which is a diamond grading report. These grading reports are detailed documents created by diamond grading experts at highly-respected diamond laboratories. These diamond grading reports are extremely expensive to replace and as a result of this, Belgium WebNet requires each diamond grading report to be included with each returned diamond. If you do not include the diamond grading report with your return, you will be charged a replacement fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00).</p>
                                <h2>Passage of the title</h2>

Belgium WebNet requires that all deliveries must be made to a physical business or home address only - we do not ship to P.O. Box addresses. We also require an adult to sign for the delivery for orders over $250.</p>
                                <h2>Cancellation of the products </h2>
                                <p>Belgium WebNet reserves the right to cancel products or services to any customer for any reason at any time. The customer's sole remedy in such cases will be the full refund of any funds that we have collected in reference to the canceled products and/or services.</p>

You agree that any action at law or in equity or any dispute, claim or controversy  arising out of or relating to these Conditions or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or purchases from the Site thereof, (collectively, “Claims”) shall be resolved by binding arbitration, as described below, instead of in court, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court. You further agree that arbitration must be on an individual basis and that you are hereby waiving your right to join or consolidate Claims in arbitration or arbitrate any claims as a representative or member of a purported class. You acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to a trial by jury. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Conditions, as well as any other contractual agreement that you have with the Company.</p>
                                <p>You acknowledge and agree that, by agreeing to these Conditions, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that any such arbitration must proceed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or JAMS in San Francisco County, California, before a mutually agreed upon single arbitrator licensed to practice law.  It will be conducted in accordance with the then-prevailing Arbitration Rules of the AAA and the arbitrator shall be bound by these Conditions. The arbitrator shall have authority to award or grant legal, equitable, and declaratory relief.  Such arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

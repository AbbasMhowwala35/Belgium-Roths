                            <h2>WHY GET A JEWELRY APPRAISAL? </h2>
                            <p>A jewelry appraisal is critical for insurance purposes. An appraisal is a document that contains information about the jewelry in question, such as its weight, rarity, color, and quality. These descriptions are typically given in specific measurements, and in addition, appraisals include an approximate value for your jewelry. This is the value that your insurance will use as proof of your ownership of this piece,
                                and should your jewelry ever get stolen, lost, or damaged, your insurance will cover the damage based on the value on your appraisal. </p>
                            <p>Every piece of jewelry is uniquely valuable, no matter how new or old. An appraisal will not only help you determine how much your jewelry is worth, but it will grant you peace of mind and protection. Better yet, with the jewelry and ring appraisal Charlotte,
                                NC residents have trusted for decades, Belgium Webnet makes the appraisal process simple and painless. </p>

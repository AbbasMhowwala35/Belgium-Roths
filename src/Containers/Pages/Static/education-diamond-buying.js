                            <h2>DIAMOND WEIGHT & SIZE</h2>
                            <p>Some people want to buy the biggest diamond possible. Is this always the right choice? We feel that it's always a matter of preference, but here's something to think about:</p>
                            <p>The larger the diamond, chances are the more inclusions it likely has, and because it's larger, these inclusions are typically even more visible than on a smaller diamond. But most importantly, if the diamond cut isn't proportioned correctly, it won't return the maximum amount of light through the top of the diamond.</p>
                            <p>This illustrates that no matter how large the diamond, its cut and proportions determine how brilliant the diamond really is.</p>
                            <h2>DIAMOND COLOR</h2>
                            <p>Since diamond colors range from colorless to yellowish-brown, sometimes these colors can add warmth or depth to your diamond. Also, by mounting a non-colorless diamond in yellow gold can make the diamond appear colorless in some cases.</p>
                            <p>We are always happy to share our expertise about diamonds. Please let us know how we can help you make a confident decision in your diamond purchase.</p>

                                <h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>
                                <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information Belgium WebNet, LLC (“Belgium WebNet”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collects, why we collect this information, and how we use the information we collect as well as your rights and choices regarding such information. Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control, or make available (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
                                <p>By using the Service, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and to our collection, use, and disclosure practices and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service.</p>
                                <p>Belgium WebNet encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to learn about our privacy practices. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact Belgium WebNet as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below.</p>
                                <h2>Data Controller</h2>
                                <p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Belgium WebNet, located at the address in the section entitled “Contact Us” below, is the controller with respect to information you provide through the Service.</p>
                                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                                <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
                                <p>We collect information you provide directly via the Service, including when you register an account, update your profile, access our content, make a purchase, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, survey, or other promotion (“Promotion”), contact customer support, or apply for a job. We may use Service Providers (defined below) to collect this information.</p>
                                <p>The information we collect includes information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination). Some examples of information we collect include the following:</p>
                                <p><strong>Contact Data.</strong> We collect your first and last name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.</p>
                                <p><strong>Credentials</strong>We collect passwords and other information for authentication and account access.</p>
                                <p><strong>Demographic Data.</strong>We collect demographic information including your age, gender, and country.</p>
                                <p><strong>Payment Data.</strong>We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.</p>
                                <p><strong>Profile Data.</strong>We collect your interests, favorites, wish lists, ring size preferences, and other profile data.</p>
                                <p><strong>Contacts.</strong>We collect data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you. For example, when you e-mail a product to a friend or refer a friend through the Service, we request that you provide names and e-mail addresses for you and your friend. This helps ensure that your friend will know that you have requested that Belgium WebNet send them an e-mail. The information Belgium WebNet collects from you and your friend will only be used in ways as set forth in this Privacy Policy. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.</p>
                                <p><strong>Content.</strong>We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support. For example, if you contact a customer service representative or jewelry consultant and provide information to the consultant or submit a request through our Service, we will use your information to respond to your request and to provide you with additional information that we believe may be helpful to you. We may also collect content such as photos, videos or other content that you submit to us.</p>
                                <p><strong>Resume Data.</strong>We collect data as necessary to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, including your employment history, transcript, writing samples, and references.</p>
                                <p>You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.</p>
                                <h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>

                                <p>Belgium WebNet collects data through the use of cookies, web logs, web beacons and other tracking technologies (now and hereafter developed) (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:</p>
                                <p><strong>Log Files.</strong>Our server logs automatically collect information, such as your IP address, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit, which helps us track users' movements around our site and understand trends.</p>
                                <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device's hard drive.

These third parties only receive your information if such information is needed to perform their function(s), and they are not authorized to use such information for any other purpose(s) other than the purpose(s) set forth by Belgium WebNet. We only provide third-parties with the minimum amount of information necessary to complete the requested service, product or transaction. Notwithstanding the above, we may permit our Service Providers to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes.</p>

                                <p><strong>Special Events:</strong>If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a Promotion), Belgium WebNet may share your information with those organizations participating in the applicable event. Typically, these third parties do not use your information for any other purpose other than to manage the event. In some cases these third-party partners may send you promotional materials regarding their products and services. In these cases, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out, and not have your information shared with that third-party partner. By entering a Promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</p>
                                <p><strong>Feedback, Testimonials and User Provided Content.</strong>If you provide feedback or testimonials on the Service or on Belgium WebNet products or services, or provide other User Provided Content (such as photos or videos), we may post and share this feedback, testimonial or other User Provided Content, including your information, on the Service, with third party partners, or in marketing and promotional materials. We may, by our sole discretion, edit feedback, testimonials or User Provided Content for length and content. California residents and data subjects in Europe have additional rights as set forth in “Your Rights and Choices” below.</p>
                                <p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We may share your information with third parties for purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Service) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Service and advertising effectiveness, and enabling other enhancements.</p>
                                <p><strong>Business Transfer.</strong>Your information may be disclosed as part of, or in connection with, any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, in which information would be transferred as one of the business assets of Belgium WebNet.</p>
                                <p><strong>Security, Compliance with Law, and Fraud Protection.</strong>We may disclose your information as we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We also may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, including suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law. We may also share your information to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service or any third party.</p>
                                <p><strong>Consent.</strong>We may share your information for any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</p>
                                <p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law.

                                <h2>Third Parties</h2>
                                <h2>Third Party Services</h2>

We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) websites and services. These Third Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
                                <h2>Third Party Features</h2>
                                <p>We may allow you to connect our Service to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“Third Party Features”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:</p>
                                <p><strong>Liking and Sharing.</strong>We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on your Belgium WebNet account through, Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service, we may collect any information you have authorized the Third Party Service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data). Likewise, if you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service or visit our Service while logged in to that Third Party Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Service and be able to associate that information with information the Third Party Service already has about you.</p>
                                <h2>Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
                                <p>Our Service contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).</p>
                                <p>We may serve ads on Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, which are targeted to reach people (or similar people) on those services that have visited our Service or that are also identified in one of more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by matching common factors between our data and the data of Third Party Services. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Services’ failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.</p>

                                <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below and specify which right you intend to exercise.

                                <p>We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>

Data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country of residence.
